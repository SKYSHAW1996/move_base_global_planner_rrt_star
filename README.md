# Randomly Exploring Random Tree Path Planner ROS Plugin
This plugin implements a simulated Randomly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planner for the Kinetic Kame release of the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. It uses the nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner interface and can be used on any platforms that implement the move_base package, but has been specifically tested using the simulated Turtlebot platform.

A presentation on the project can be found on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/YW-AWwA-fv8). The video provides an overview of the project, UML diagrams, as well as a demo.

## Personnel
This plugin was created by [Jessica Howard](jmhoward@umd.edu) as a final project for the University of Maryland course ENPM808X - Software Development for Robotics during the Fall 2017 semester.

## Installation
Clone the package into your catkin workspace:
```
cd [workspace]/src
git clone https://github.com/jeshoward/turtlebot_rrt.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source ~/[workspace]/devel/setup.bash
```
source ~/catkin_ws_project/devel/setup.bash

### Dependencies
1. ROS Kinetic Kame [(Installation Instructions)](docs/README_DEPENDENCIES.md#ros)
2. Catkin [(Installation Instructions)](docs/README_DEPENDENCIES.md#catkin)
3. Rviz [(Installation Instructions)](/docs/README_DEPENDENCIES.md#rviz)
4. Gazebo [(Installation Instructions)](/docs/README_DEPENDENCIES.dm#gazebo)

## Usage
To run the plugin out of the box, follow the steps in the [demo](#demo-steps).
The plugin uses a static map and is currently only packaged with a single map. To create custom maps follow the instructions [provided here](#creating-custom-maps). Once you have created your map place the ```.world```, ```.yaml```, and ```.pgm``` file into the ```/maps```  directory all using the same file name and then use the ```map_name``` arg with the launch file:
```
roslaunch turtlebot_rrt rrt_planner.launch
```

### Launch file args
```map_name``` indicates the map that you want to use. This assumes that you already have a ```.world```, ```.yaml```, and a ```.pgm``` file in the ```/maps``` directory.

```step_size``` indicates the size of the step that the RRT algorithm uses. Sometimes called epsilon. A lower value is more accurate, a higher value is faster. Parameter is entered in meters. Has a default value of 2.5.

```max_iterations``` determines the maximum number of vertices that will be created searching for a path between the starting point and the goal. This prevents infinite loops in the event the goal is unreachable. Parameter is an integer. Has a default value of 200,000.

```delta``` is the incremental amount that will be checked along each step_size for obstacles. Choosing a lower value is more accurate, a higher value is faster. Parameter is entered in meters. Has a default value of 1.0.

```goal_radius``` is how close you have to be to the goal for it to count. Parameter is entered in meters. Has a default value of 1.0.

### Demo Steps
These steps assume that you have already cloned the repository, if not see [Installation](#installation).

1. Run the demo launch file 
```
roslaunch turtlebot_rrt rrt_planner.launch
```
![alt tag]( docs/images/turtlebot_rrt_demo.png  "Simple Maze map displayed in Rviz and Gazebo")

2. To set a goal for the robot switch to the Rviz window and and click "2D Nav Goal" at the top and select on the map where you want the robot to go.

#### Creating Custom Maps
A single demo map has been provided here, if you want to create your own Gazebo worlds and this RRT algorithm to navigate them follow [this](docs/MAP_CONVERSION.md) tutorial.

### Test Steps
These steps assume that you have already cloned the repository, if not see [Installation](#installation).

```
cd [workspace]/src
catkin_make run_tests && catkin_test_results
```
